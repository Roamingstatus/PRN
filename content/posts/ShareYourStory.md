Every healthcare professional has stories to tell about the highs and lows in their career, stories shared with friends and family.

These valuable or horrifying moments should be shared to encourage and teach, providing a glimpse into what this profession offers, especially for newcomers.

I hope to start a new section on my blog showcasing these moments, so I encourage you, whatever your story is, to share it here => [prnrants@gmail.com](mailto:prnrants@gmail.com)

If I receive enough stories and start this new section on my blog, I can begin offering giveaways based on reactions and polls from readers.
