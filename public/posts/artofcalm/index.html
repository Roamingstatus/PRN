<p>How caring are you still after a long string of rude patients cursing you out, or another CIWA patient trying to hit you, or that cute elderly patient slapping you?</p>
<p>With all the stressors of life, let alone the ones in the nursing field, weighing heavily on nurses, it&rsquo;s understandable to get upset in these situations.</p>
<p>I truly believe that the way a nurse reacts sets the tone for the shift, the entire hospital stay, and maybe even the rest of the patients&rsquo; and nurses&rsquo; lives. This is influenced by various factors, including the collective mood, workload burdens, and personalities of the caregivers.</p>
<p>This is what determines the outcome: peaceful resolutions versus the use of chemical or physical interventions to achieve what we sometimes perceive as a good outcome. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; these measures are absolutely necessary in some cases, but are they always?</p>
