Fundamentally, nursing is about caring, right?

How caring are you still after a long string of rude patients cursing you out, or another CIWA patient trying to hit you, or that cute elderly patient slapping you?

With all the stressors of life, let alone the ones in the nursing field, weighing heavily on nurses, it's understandable to get upset in these situations.

I truly believe that the way a nurse reacts sets the tone for the shift, the entire hospital stay, and maybe even the rest of the patients' and nurses' lives. This is influenced by various factors, including the collective mood, workload burdens, and personalities of the caregivers.

This is what determines the outcome: peaceful resolutions versus the use of chemical or physical interventions to achieve what we sometimes perceive as a good outcome. Don't get me wrong; these measures are absolutely necessary in some cases, but are they always?
