<p>If it were possible to pull back the blinds and see what our founders&rsquo; intentions were, how they practiced then, and how they practiced five decades ago.</p>
<p>As I referenced yesterday, chemical and physical solutions are sometimes necessary. However, the healthcare field has instituted changes in the last couple of decades that I&rsquo;ve been practicing to understand that these measures aren&rsquo;t always necessary and can lead to negative outcomes at times.</p>
<p>Yet, I still feel like a lot slips through the cracks.</p>
<p>Two worlds collide when a nurse shows up to work, and a patient surrenders to the hospital. Two different personalities, different moods, going through different or similar circumstances in life, shaped by life in completely different ways. Sometimes it&rsquo;s one patient (misunderstood) at times versus a gang of different personalities (caregivers).</p>
<p>Sometimes, depending on the sum of personality, mood, and current life events of the caregiver(s) versus patient(s), this (&ldquo;chemical&rdquo;) reaction is undesirable/incompatible. The caregiver(s) and patient(s) just don&rsquo;t see eye to eye or don&rsquo;t understand each other. Situations like these sometimes escalate, and without healthy, stable-minded deescalators present, or if the culture of the setting that the patient is in doesn&rsquo;t accommodate or tolerate the patient&rsquo;s current state, it can lead to what I consider convenience measures, chemical or physical.</p>
<p>Thus, this most likely leads to negative patient outcomes and what most people don&rsquo;t consider, negative caregiver outcomes. It perpetuates a culture, habits, and mentality of reacting only for convenience instead of stepping back and considering the long-term effects of short-fused decisions.</p>
<p>I feel like some institutions encourage these hasty reactions by not teaching their staff to look at the bigger picture and then wonder why they have a large number of negative incidents. Am I wrong? Am I delusional for thinking we could react in a more caring fashion and relearn the <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/artofcalm/">Art of Calm</a></p>
