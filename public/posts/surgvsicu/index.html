<p>[<img src="/images/blgimg2.jpeg" alt="targets">]</p>
<p>You ever worked in that hospital , on that unit where you’re running around and you look around and the other nurses were just sitting , browsing….</p>
<p>Up until 2 years ago I worked in acute care, I’ve worked in a few of these units , and in I feel like most of nights went like above. I should also mention that I primarily work nights.
I would sit and watch the routine of these MedSurg/ Tele nurses, the mad rush to finish your tasks and then “have  a good night “, and complain if you had a patient(s) disrupt this routine.</p>
<p>But then I went to critical care and you quickly realize your patient is everyone’s patient and you check on everyone’s patient.
Those ICU nurses are constantly not only asking if you need help but helping and this is before even things go south and then everyone is there helping ( but not in all ICU’s)</p>
<p>Is this just a night shift thing ?</p>
