      <description>Nursing has obviously evolved into the technologically advanced, almost cure-all profession we know today.&#xA;If it were possible to pull back the blinds and see what our founders&amp;rsquo; intentions were, how they practiced then, and how they practiced five decades ago.&#xA;As I referenced yesterday, chemical and physical solutions are sometimes necessary. However, the healthcare field has instituted changes in the last couple of decades that I&amp;rsquo;ve been practicing to understand that these measures aren&amp;rsquo;t always necessary and can lead to negative outcomes at times.</description>
