You ever worked in that hospital , on that unit where you’re running around and you look around and the other nurses were just sitting , browsing….
Up until 2 years ago I worked in acute care, I’ve worked in a few of these units , and in I feel like most of nights went like above. I should also mention that I primarily work nights. I would sit and watch the routine of these MedSurg/ Tele nurses, the mad rush to finish your tasks and then “have a good night “, and complain if you had a patient(s) disrupt this routine.&hellip;

	Nursing has obviously evolved into the technologically advanced, almost cure-all profession we know today.
If it were possible to pull back the blinds and see what our founders&rsquo; intentions were, how they practiced then, and how they practiced five decades ago.
As I referenced yesterday, chemical and physical solutions are sometimes necessary. However, the healthcare field has instituted changes in the last couple of decades that I&rsquo;ve been practicing to understand that these measures aren&rsquo;t always necessary and can lead to negative outcomes at times.&hellip;

	Fundamentally, nursing is about caring, right?
How caring are you still after a long string of rude patients cursing you out, or another CIWA patient trying to hit you, or that cute elderly patient slapping you?
With all the stressors of life, let alone the ones in the nursing field, weighing heavily on nurses, it&rsquo;s understandable to get upset in these situations.
I truly believe that the way a nurse reacts sets the tone for the shift, the entire hospital stay, and maybe even the rest of the patients&rsquo; and nurses&rsquo; lives.&hellip;

	!Disclaimer!
These are just my personal views, opinions, and rants about the nursing field. I&rsquo;m definitely no expert writer and even with the two decades of experience in the field, I do not make any claims to be the foremost expert in this field . What I&rsquo;m hoping for is funny but respectful comments, constructive criticism and any valuable input. I&rsquo;m hoping to grow , become better by interacting with my peers on this forum.&hellip;
